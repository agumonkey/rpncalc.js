# DESCRIPTION
JavaScript RPN Calculator
How many reverse Poles does it take to change a light bulb?

I wrote this program for efficient keyboard entry, not for mousey-clicky-clicky like most JavaScript calculator applications are. If you don't see a blinking cursor in the ENTRY box, just click in that box to continue.

This is not guaranteed to work. I'm only developing for Firefox at this time.
